# Data Sources and Annotation Practices

## Where does Intact data come from?

IntAct populates molecular interactions from experimentally-derived interaction data available in the published scientific literature and from direct scientists' submissions prior to publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

## What advantages does it have to submit data to IntAct?

There are several benefits from direct user submission. First, it establishes an author-curator direct link that ensures proper and often richer representation of the data, having helped in the past to detect manuscript errors that were corrected before publication. In some cases, details that are not representable through the article text are made available in the database entry and this link between database and data provider has become an on-going collaboration. Secondly, pre-publication data submissions embed a direct reference to the database entry in the manuscript, increasing the visibility and re-usability of the data. Finally, it also ensures that the data is available to users around the manuscript publication date.

## How do I submit data to IntAct?

If you are willing to submit your data into IntAct, please visit our [Data Submission](../../data-submission/) documentation.

## Why does the number of interactions given in a particular high-throughput paper, differ from the number I can download from IntAct from the same publication?

Authors state the number of interactions they have identified, based on protein sequence identifications made at the time of going to press. When we upload this data into the IntAct molecular interaction database, we map these identifications to the UniProtKB protein sequence database, so that our users can benefit from the high-quality manual annotation of these sequences performed by the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot curators. The number of interactions can vary both as a result of this process and also as a result of time for the following reasons.

* The author may have used a redundant database to identify their proteins. We often find separate identifiers map to a common non-redundant UniProtKB entry and an interaction turns out to have been identified twice, but originally assigned to different protein IDs.
* Proteins may have been withdrawn from the protein sequence database over time - this is particularity true for predicted proteins based on gene models. If we cannot remap the protein to an appropriate alternative, we may have to withdraw the interaction.
* Gene models may merge resulting in only one interacting pair being identified, where previously there was thought to be two.
* Gene models may be split over time - in this case any interaction based on a protein product of the original gene model will have to be withdrawn unless we have enough data to tell us which of the new proteins is involved in the interaction.
* Authors may submit additional interactions which they did not describe in the original paper but were generated by the same method. This will be maintained separately and labelled as such.
* Some interactions pairs included by the author may break the annotation rules of both the IntAct molecular interaction database and the IMEx consortium If so, these interactions are excluded and a note added as a "data-processing" comment to explain why.

## Are all the molecules reported in an interaction directly binding?

No, not all the interactions represented in IntAct can be considered as direct binary contacts between the molecules involved. In fact, most of the experimental interaction data that we curate does not allow to say whether an interaction is direct or not.

The 'Interaction type' column can help you find out if an interacting pair is directly binding. We distinguish three major types of interaction:

* [**Direct interaction**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0407): Interaction that happens between molecules that are in direct contact with each other. We reserve this annotation for evidence found through methods that use purified molecules, not cell extracts or other complex samples, so we can 100% sure that there are no undetected participants bridging the interaction \(e.g. the structure of two co-crystallized, purified proteins\). Enzymatic reactions, curated exclusively when using purified participants, fall under this category, but we use interaction types depicting the specific reaction \(e.g. a [phosphorylation reaction](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0217)\).
* [**Physical association**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0915): Interaction between molecules within the same physical complex, complex being defined as a group of molecules that are physically in contact at the same point in time. A physical association **does not imply a direct contact**, even if it refers to an interaction with only two participants. The annotation implies they are together in the same complex, but there could be undetected participants that bridge the interaction, so no proof of directness is given. Physical associations typically refer to interactions with two participants, but can sometimes involve more. 
* [**Association**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0914): Interaction between molecules that may participate in formation of one, but possibly more, physical complexes. The experimental evidence behind the interaction does not allow to determine if one of more interacting complexes are being detected. That is, alternative combinations of interacting molecules are possible. An association always has more than two participants, even though [spoke-expanded](../../docs/expansion-method.md) associations may appear as expanded binaries in our results table.
