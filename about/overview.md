# Overview

The Molecular Interactions team produces the IntAct database of evidence for molecular interactions, and maintains the [Complex Portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home) reference resource for macromolecular complexes. The team's primary goal is to help researchers make the most of public interaction data, and to facilitate the adoption of standards in this important area of molecular biology. We provide regular training on our resources and interact regularly with our users to ensure our services respond to their needs.
