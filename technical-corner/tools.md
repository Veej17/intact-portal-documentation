## IntAct Cytoscape App

Our bespoke [IntAct App](https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/intactapp) lets users query IntAct directly through Cytoscape and create Molecular Interaction networks within Cytoscape.

IntAct App provides 2 entry points for building these networks:
- Fuzzy Search: create big networks for concepts, e.g. Kinase, "Cell cycle", etc.
- Exact Query: create small to medium networks for (lists of) specific sets of molecules, e.g. brca1, tp53, etc.
