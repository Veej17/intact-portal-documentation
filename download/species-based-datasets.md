# Species-based Datasets

16 bespoke species-specific datasets are generated with each release and are available [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/interactomes)

This includes our bespoke dataset for [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/search?query=2697049&interactorSpeciesFilter=SARS-CoV-2). A dataset for interactions involving proteins from coronaviruses in general can be found [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/download/datasets#curated).

The data are based on the taxonomy of the proteins taking part in the interaction. Analysis of one such dataset, which involves _Arabidopsis_ proteins, has been discussed in PMID: [20371643](http://europepmc.org/article/MED/20371643).
