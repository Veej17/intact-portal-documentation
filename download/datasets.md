## Datasets of interactions of biological significance

We provide several different types of precomputed interaction datasets:

- By biological topics: manually curated datasets that are either [manually](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/datasets#curated) or [computationally](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/datasets#computationally) assigned as being relevant to a specific area of biology.
- 16 species-specifc [interactomes](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/datasets#species).
- [Mutations](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/datasets#mutations): contains annotations of experimental evidence where mutations have been shown to affect a protein interaction.
