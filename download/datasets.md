## Datasets of interactions of biological significance

We provide several different types of precomputed interaction datasets:

- By biological topics: manually curated datasets that are either manually or computationally assigned as being relevant to a specific area of biology.
- 16 species-specifc interactomes.
- Mutations: contains annotations of experimental evidence where mutations have been shown to affect a protein interaction.
