# Species-based Datasets

16 bespoke species-specific datasets are generated with each release from the protein-protein interaction data curated from peer reviewed journals and are available [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/interactomes) including our bespoke dataset for [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/search?query=2697049&interactorSpeciesFilter=SARS-CoV-2).

The data are based on the taxonomy of the proteins taking part in the interaction. Analysis of one such dataset, which involved Arabidopsis proteins has been discussed in PMID: [20371643](http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/22/4/997).
