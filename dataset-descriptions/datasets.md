## Datasets of biological significance

We provide 4 types of interaction datasets:

### Topical: 

Manually curated datasets that are either [manually](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/datasets#curated) or [computationally](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/datasets#computationally) assigned to a specific biological topic.

### Interactomes:

For 16 different [species](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/datasets#species).

### Mutations: 

Annotations of experimental evidence where [mutations](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/documentation/datasets#mutations) have been shown to affect a protein interaction.
